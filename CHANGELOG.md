## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Agent Orchestrator** — shared working memory for parallel Claude Code sessions on one
  problem (planner / coders / runner). Sessions register automatically through
  hooks; each prompt delivers a compact delta of what teammates did. Works with
  a single Claude account (sessions are per-terminal) or several installs.
  - Shared tasks: idempotent `task add` (safe to re-emit), **atomic**
    single-winner `claim`, `next --role --claim` for looped worker sessions,
    the `review` → `done` / `reopen --reason` verification cycle, and
    dependencies (`--needs`) so `next` only hands out ready work.
  - `note` / `board` / `team` groups; role work-cycles auto-injected per
    session (planner/coder/runner) — no standing prompts to paste.
  - Live session states on the board — working / waiting for input /
    needs-you — driven by the new `Stop` and `Notification` hooks.
  - `board --watch`: an interactive TUI (`[tui]` extra) — task table +
    bot-style live feed + click-for-detail bar, theme browser (`t`,
    autosaved), local screenshots (`s`), feed autoscroll toggle (`a`) and a
    select-text mode (`v`/`c`). Rich full-screen fallback without the extra.
  - **Long-term memory (gbrain)**: durable events (decisions, results, task
    outcomes, reopen feedback) distill into a per-project gbrain brain via a
    detached, flock-guarded worker; `recall` searches it. Never on the hot
    path; degrades silently when gbrain is absent.
  - **`serve`** (`[serve]` extra): the orchestrator as an MCP server (stdio or
    bearer-token HTTP) so remote Claude clients — e.g. a browser-debugging
    agent in the Claude desktop app — join as attributed virtual sessions.
  - Multi-repo executions via `AISQUARE_TEAM_HUB`; worktree-safe project
    identity (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`); `agents connect --config-dir`
    for parallel `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` installs.
  - **Semantic recall**: with `AISQUARE_BRAIN_EMBED=1` (and an
    `OPENAI_API_KEY`) distilled pages are embedded and `recall` uses gbrain's
    hybrid vector+keyword search, falling back to keyword when unavailable.
    The embedding schema is fixed at brain-creation time, so the knob must be
    set before the first distill; `doctor` flags a knob-vs-schema mismatch and
    points at the rebuild (`team distill --all`).
  - Env knobs (no config gating): `AISQUARE_TEAM`, `AISQUARE_ROLE`,
    `AISQUARE_TEAM_HUB`, `AISQUARE_TEAM_DELTA`, `AISQUARE_TEAM_LEASE_MIN`,
    `AISQUARE_BRAIN`, `AISQUARE_BRAIN_EMBED`, `AISQUARE_BRAIN_EMBED_MODEL`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

First release — a portable memory layer for coding agents.

### Added

- **Context store** (local SQLite): `remember` and the `context` group — `add`,
  `list`, `show`, `edit`, `remove`, `search` (FTS5), `promote`, `import`,
  `export`, `preview` — across `user` and `project` pools, with sync-ready
  metadata (soft-delete tombstones, `updated_at`) and time-sortable,
  prefix-addressable ids.
- **`inject` / `why`** — assemble in-scope context for an agent session and
  explain the last injection.
- **Projects** — `init`, the `project` group (`info` / `list` / `switch` /
  `link`), and `onboard`, which packs a Repomix codebase snapshot (full pack +
  skeleton + per-file index).
- **Claude Code integration** — `agents` group with `connect` that installs
  `SessionStart` + `UserPromptSubmit` hooks (injecting context and capturing
  prompts), plus detection (`scan` / `list` / `status`) and `disconnect`.
- **Diagnostics & config** — `status`, `doctor` (dependency + setup health with
  fixes), the `config` group, and `log` (captured prompt history).
